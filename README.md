“


I’m not sure how to tell you this, but you’re kind of a big deal.

If it’s time to raise your voice and build your brand, I can help. 


I’m in Costa Rica for the year! Yep. .I’ve traded in my boots for flip flops and now you’ll find me working remotely amidst palm trees in a halter top and a cowgirl hat.  
What’s my story ?
I’ve been helping executives-turned-consultants get noticed, get clients and get BRAVE with their brand since 2002. 
How? I mine you for your magic, so you can show up BIGGER and BRIGHTER online. 
My past includes corporate drudgery, B-movie acting, mamahood, dancing and plenty of hitchhiking in dangerous countries.  
Come my dear, let’s reveal your brilliance, one layer at a time.

--Book a FREE LinkedIn Lovefest
--I Want My Voice to Be Heard
--I’m Tired of Hating My LinkedIn Profile
--I’m Ready to Outsource this Shit!
 


TESTIMONIAL 

“Not only did Andrea give me a kick-ass LinkedIn profile and one sheet, but her process requires soul searching and introspection to figure out “who you want to be when you get beyond corporate.”

--Mark Defee, 



“Andrea carefully listens and observes her clients to extract their best qualities and true self. Plus, the Boot-Factor process is fun – we laughed half of the time. Get yourself some Boot-Factor action!”

--Carm Cicalese, 



"I was incredibly impressed by this process. When you're too close to a thing, it's hard to see clearly. But Andrea distilled my core knowledge, beliefs, and values down to quickly digestible sound bites in ways that left little on the table. When you work with Andrea it's a true partnership. You need to show up with vulnerability, but the return is worth the investment all day long."

--Marisa Rybar, 

"Andrea has a natural way of engaging me with close listening and then channeling  observations through your own creative voice; it's such a delight to collaborate with her."
--Peter Harper, Real Leaders


I work with ex-corporate coaches and consultants who…
--Are done writing their own bio 
--Have exhausted their network
--Want to curate the RIGHT clients
--Know it’s time to up-level
--Hear their intuition whispering 



Outcomes
--A NEW LinkedIn Profile that gets noticed
--A sexy ONE SHEET that you’ll end up sending to everyone 

--Messaging for your favorite clients
--The right answer when people ask what you do
--Go-to messaging for curriculum, keynotes and emails
--Inspiration to wear more hats
--More self-love
--Realization that you’re a thought leader

“When you market to everyone, you market to no one.”  

--Best advice I ever got.

“If you want to be boring, leave nothing out.”

--Voltaire
